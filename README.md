# Basic-Attendance-System
Nathan Mizzi IT-SWD-6.1A, Level 6 OOP Assignment repository.

This attendance system is based off of an assignment that was created by me in my first year of studies.
It's aim is to act as an attendance management system, and was created using object oriented programming.

The application itself is a C# console app, and can simply be run, given that the database is created properly and attached.
